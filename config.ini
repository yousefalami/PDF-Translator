[API]
# Full URL to your WebAI-to-API server endpoint.
# Ensure this points to the /v1/chat/completions endpoint.
# Example for a local server running on the default port (6969 for WebAI-to-API):
url = http://localhost:6969/v1/chat/completions

# Model name for the translation API.
# You can find available model names in your API's documentation (e.g., Gemini API).
# "gemini-2.0-flash" is a common default model.
model = gemini-2.0-flash

# Font name to be used in the generated Word document.
# If left empty or not specified, the script will default to "Arial".
# Ensure the font is installed on the system where the script runs.
# Example: Calibri, Times New Roman, Arial
font_name = Calibri

# Prompt template for instructing the translation API.
# IMPORTANT: This template MUST include the following three placeholders:
#   {source_language} - Will be replaced with the source language name (e.g., "Persian").
#   {target_language} - Will be replaced with the target language name (e.g., "English").
#   {text_to_translate} - Will be replaced with the actual text chunk from the PDF.
#
# Customize this template to match the expected input format of your API
# and to guide the model for the desired translation output (e.g., style, tone, verbosity).
prompt_template = Translate the following text from {source_language} to {target_language}. I need only the translated text itself, without any additional comments, greetings, or the original text repeated. The text to translate is:\n\n```{text_to_translate}```
